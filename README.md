During this module, Iâ€™ve chosen to implement an Inventory Management application. The application requires maintaining users for the sake of authentication. The user can log in if already registered or can register to use the application. The main functions of this application involve inventory management of the application where users can add/update/delete a product and can list the products. User and product information is stored in the database. The application also let the user send SMS notifications. 

I have used simple and intuitive UI/UX components and implemented the screen in a way that users can easily navigate between them. Each screen distinguishes its functionality that the user can easily use to manage the product inventory. The overall UI/UX theme is consistent, simple, and intuitive. 

I planned the application first in project one. During project two I implemented the wireframes and UI screens. During Project Three I started with small codes, one thing at one time. First, I wrote the entity classes, moved to write the Adapter to be used in the product grid, and moved ahead to implement the database layer. Once the database layer is ready, I started writing the Activity codes (code behind UI screens).  Complete one screen, tested its functionality, and moved to the next one until I finished all the codes. 

As a beginner, I think one should follow the steps in sequence, collect requirements, refine them, design the application, prepare a prototype and then implement the backend functionality. Keep testing as you progress so that logical and other functional errors can be fixed on the fly instead of testing a monolithic application after everything is done. This can save a lot of time, as you can debug and fix smaller code. 

The most successful component is the grid implementation, which is loading the data from the database using a customer adapter, a custom row layout used to display the product information, and how to manipulate the selected product by moving its information to the update screen.
